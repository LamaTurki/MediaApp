# MediaApp
This app is part of Session 5 of Uconnet ABND
the app consists of a main activity that displays the two fragment lists 
using ViewPager and TabLayout. The list items is populated with a custom 
ArrayAdapter for our class "media" with 3 members. When an item is clicked 
the PlayerActivity starts and putExtra() method was used to send right info
about the track for the new activity to handle.
